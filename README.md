Group Members: Prat Kothiyal (pk383), Bjorn Teo (jt667), Ignacio Arevalo (iaa26)

Brief project description:

Suppose we are an electronics store deciding what and how much inventory to stock to keep up with demand. Furthermore, we may want to predict the reason for non-recommendations on some electronics in order to give feedback to our manufacturer, build better store warranties, educate our consumers, and train our support team on helping disgruntled customers. Our project seeks to investigate a large dataset of electronics product reviews collected from several online retail websites in order to determine whether a product is considered popular or not. The dataset itself has fields for each product's brand and model name, and detailed review information incuding rating, how many users found the review helpful, the review title and content, and the website where the review came from.
